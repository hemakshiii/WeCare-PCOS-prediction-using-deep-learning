# WeCare-PCOS-prediction-usiong-deep-learning
Polycystic ovary syndrome is a kind of a disorder found in women at 15-45 age. 
During this women suffers from various symptoms i.e hair loss, irregular periods cycle, excess of body hair, pimples etc.
To predict PCOS the system are already available but it requires sonography reports to overcome this, the project has been introduced.
In this project deep learning model i.e Multilayer perceptron algorithm is used to predict PCOS among women. As it is classification and regression algo it provides output in 0 and 1.
Standard data is taken from kaggle and based on that data it gives the output.


In this website the form has been given which has to fill by user or say doctor, all fields are mandatory to fill and based on that input it predicts whether women has pcos or not.
Input parameters are nothing but symptoms and some clinical parameters to fill.
This project also provide some remedies page to overcome pcos and also some articles to read.
